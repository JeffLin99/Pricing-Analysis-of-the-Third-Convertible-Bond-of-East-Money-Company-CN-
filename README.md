1. Project Background:

The academic study of convertible bond pricing models spans over 60 years. It began in the 1960s with a straightforward approach of discounting the higher of bond value and convertible value. Later, the Black-Scholes option pricing formula (1973) and the Merton corporate bond pricing theory (1974) brought a more scientific perspective. Other scholars like Ingersoll (1977) and Brennan and Schwartz (1977) expanded these ideas, leading to the modern framework for convertible bond pricing.

2. East Money Company Convertible Bond 1 Theoretical Pricing vs Actual Price

Convertible bond pricing models can be categorized into simple and structural models, as well as single-factor and multi-factor models. The key factors affecting convertible bond value are company value, interest rates, and credit risk. Assessing company value is crucial. This results in models that treat the entire company value as a variable ("structural models") or use the stock price as a variable ("simple models"). These models can have varying numbers of factors, creating single-factor, two-factor, and multi-factor models.

In this study, three models (Black-Scholes, binomial tree, and Monte Carlo) were applied to price the option value of East Money Convertible Bond 1. These were combined with an estimate of the bond's pure price using a cash flow discounting model. The theoretical price was then compared to the actual price and stock price, and the strengths and weaknesses of each model were analyzed.

3. Conclusion

This study investigates the pricing dynamics of East Money Convertible Bond 1 using various models and their correlation with stock prices. Initially, the research employs rolling regression analysis to compare theoretical and actual prices, revealing significant discrepancies within certain periods. Notably, deviations coincide with times of increased conversion premium rates, suggesting a weakening linkage between actual and estimated theoretical prices. To further explore this, the study substitutes the stock price as the independent variable and finds a similar trend. However, when using theoretical prices as the dependent variable and stock prices as the independent variable, the linkage between them remains consistently strong, demonstrating a rational correlation between the two. These findings indicate that the actual price of East Money Convertible Bond 1 is potentially influenced by speculative or manipulative activities, particularly during periods of deviated linkage between actual and theoretical prices.
